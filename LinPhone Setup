# LinPhone Configuration

Linphone is a free, open-source Voice over IP (VoIP) application that enables voice and video calls using the SIP (Session Initiation Protocol). When calling an IP phone with Linphone, it connects to the target device using its SIP address or IP address. Linphone sends signaling messages to establish the call, and once accepted, the audio stream is transmitted over the internet using codecs like Opus or G.711.
